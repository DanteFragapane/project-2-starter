# Foundation App

This is a basic foundation level application that will allow you to hit the ground running.

This contains pretty all of the ground level tooling you'll need, such as express, mysql, tests, some views, and routing. You just have to use it!

## How To

- `clone` or `fork` this repo
- `cd` into the folder on your desktop
- run `npm i`
- Good luck

## Technology

- Express
- MySQL
- EJS (Templating)
- Tape (Testing)
- StandardJs (Linting)
- Nodemon
- dotenv (Environment variables)

You should be able to get started pretty quick from this point.

Good luck, and have fun!
